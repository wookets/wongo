# Overview

I wrapper that actually unwraps a wrapper. Crazy right?

# Quick Example

    // find example
    query = {where: {name: 'mint'}}
    wongo.find 'Mock', query, (err, mocks) ->
      // mocks is just the objects (uses lean())
      done()



# Why

This library was created because I was annoyed by the little things in mongoosejs. 

* Property values on objects would sometimes randomly disappear after a find. Using a doc.get('prop') fixed the problem, but why? Surely, there was a mongoosejs bug a foot. But, small little bugs like this in ORM / Active Record patterns are what makes you want to throw the whole thing out the window. Wongo Solution: lean() and toObject() everything. 
* mongoosejs ORM behavior can have devestating consequences on large data sets. Wongo Solution: use lean() on every query that returns an array of documents.  
* I have a very personal distain for the active record pattern. Look people, I get it... It's nice to do resource.save() and not bring in another import / require statement, but it is also nice not to have a cluster of different functions and properties on my domain model. 98% of which I will never even use. I prefer the data access object pattern. But, hey, if you like the active record, keep using mongoose. There is nothing for you here. Wongo Solution: every method has a _type as the first parameter, so you dont have to mongoose.model anything. Or rely on doc.save(), which recently broke on me in my other project. Again, weird ORM bugs. 
* Populate and depopulate are great in mongoose. However, there are some oddities. For example, if you populate a property and then later simply add an _id. Don't populate something, but add an object with an _id. There are some inconsistencies that wongo attempts to solve. Wongo Solution: before saving a resource, the schema is checked and depopulation is normalized if needed.


# Running the Tests

I use mocha. So, you should be able to run the 'mocha' command in the project folder and be done. However, you will need to add a db_config.json file that has the db_config.url parameter in it. This file is not committed to git for obvious reasons. 

Here is a format you can use:

test/db_config.json

    {
    "url": "mongodb://{username}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{db}"
    }
